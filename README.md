# TotaraWrap
#The task is to write a function called 'wrap' that takes two arguments, $string and $length.
The function should return the string, but with new lines ("\n") added to ensure that no line is longer than $length characters. Always wrap at word boundaries if possible, only break a word if it is longer than $length characters. When breaking at word boundaries, replace all the whitespace between the two words with a single newline character. Any unbroken whitespace should be left unchanged.
Please implement the function directly in PHP, rather than using the built-in wordwrap() function.

## sample input string = "test test" 
## string length = 3
## sample output
